## PROJECT: INTERFACE
In information technology, the user interface (UI) is everything designed into an information device or material with which a person may interact. Determine what kind of interface you'd like to create. This can be the design of **a website, an application, a manual, a publication layout, a game** etc.

Using a combination of Illustrator / Photoshop / Any other development tools, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

An interface has varied applications:

***
**Non-Digital**
* Menu
* Brochure
* Poster
* Magazine Layout
* Manual
* Directory
* Physical Portfolio
* ETC.
***
**Digital**
* Landing page
* Navigation Menu
* Title Page/Sequence
* Portfolio Site
* Online Storefront (ie. Etsy, Amazon, Steam, App Store)
* Splash Screen
* Gameplay UI
* Character Selection Screen
* Settings Menu
* ETC.

Choose an element of your interface that will best showcase the brand you wish to create or have created. (IE. If your brand is personal, a portfolio mock-up would be appropriate. If your brand is a video game, a splash screen or a screenshot mock-up)

#### DRAFT 1: GRAYSCALE WIREFRAME
Post on your blog in grayscale with interface-wireframes category. 
* Create a wireframe of your interface in appropriate dimensions (ie. Mobile dimension, screen dimension). 
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap with interface-wireframes category. 
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 

#### DRAFT 2: COLOR PROTOTYPE
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity wireframes.
* Apply 3 different color schemes that will best showcase your interface, both in terms of clarity, readability, and aesthetic strength.
* Post on your class blog.

#### FINAL DRAFT
* Refine selection
* Post a clickable prototype on your class blog.
  * Consult the readings and/or VFS <a href="../dm1123_vfs_recommended_resources.md">resources</a> page for applications to use for prototypes.
