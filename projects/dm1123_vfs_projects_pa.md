## PROJECT: PHYSICAL APPLICATION
Your final brand in color in a physical, applied state (i.e. poster, packaging, signage, apparel, business cards, stickers, etc.). <br><br>
<strong>OR</strong><br><br>
Your final interface wireframe in a digital or physical applied state (i.e. website, game, schematic diagram, design document, etc.)

Your choice for your project’s applied state is up to you. You decide. 

#### PA 1st Draft    
Post on your class blog in grayscale (includes black and white) with physapp1 category or tag. 
* Select 1 applied state for your one and true final logo
* For that selected applied state only, do at least 3 different directions 
* In other words, if you are going to do a cd cover, all 3 different versions should be for a cd cover. If you are doing a business card, all 3 different versions should be for a business card. 
* Each version in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)
* Select only 1 applied state (yes, this is repeated.)
* The versions should NOT be for different applied states such as 1 for an album cover, tattoos, and yet another for a T-Shirt design.

#### PA 2nd Draft    
Post on your class blog in grayscale (includes black and white) or color with physapp2 category or tag. 
* Choose the version selected in the previous class crit.
* Do at least 3 different variations of the selected PA. 
* Each variation in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)
